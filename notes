Added some tapdance magic for home/pgdown end/pgup


//Tap Dance Declarations
enum {
  TD_HOME_PGD = 0,
  TD_END_PGUP = 1
};

//Tap Dance Definitions
qk_tap_dance_action_t tap_dance_actions[] = {
  //Tap once for End, twice for page down
  [TD_HOME_PGD]  = ACTION_TAP_DANCE_DOUBLE(KC_HOME, KC_PGDN),
  [TD_END_PGUP]  = ACTION_TAP_DANCE_DOUBLE(KC_END, KC_PGUP)
// Other declarations would go here, separated by commas, if you have them
};

use as keycodes:
TD(TD_HOME_PGD)
TD(TD_END_PGUP)
